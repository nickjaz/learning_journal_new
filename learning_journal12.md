# Learning Journal 12- Code 201

Today we presented our groups final project. The presentation went great. Everyone really enjoyed the konami code at the end of the presentation. The project was a little stark compared to the other groups and in hindsight I wish I would have pushed for much more functionality. In the end I'm still really happy with what we put together and I plan to work on it more once I get into 301.

Looking ahead I'm excited to move on to the next step and learn more about programming.
