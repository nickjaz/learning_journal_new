#Learning Journal 9- Code 201

I can't believe this is my final journal entry for 201. The time really did fly by. The challenges I faced really reflect back to what I know now about programming. I came in with my only expectation being that this program was going to be tough. When I reflect on all that we covered I'm happy to say I'm looking forward to more.
