#Learning Journal 7 - Code 201

Today we covered imbedding things like video and audio into html files. I probably won't be using this  unless I want a repeated video running the background. The assignment we received today was difficult at first but after some thought I was able to put the pieces together. Andy as always was a big help when it came to working through problems. He is often a step ahead of me although today he stalled himself in order for me to play an equal role in developing the JS logic.

Moving forward I'm hoping to hone my JS skills through more and more practice. I feel like a few days after each assignment is when I truly get it. Its always going to be a struggle but the struggle has taught me a lot.
