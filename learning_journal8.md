#Learning Journal 8- Code 201

Today we began discussing persisting data and did some demonstrations on how we can apply it to our current web page assignments. The application was very straight forward allowing me to start playing around with some other functionality. This also gave me some more time to help other people with their code.

Moving forward I'm really excited to start 201 project week. It's going to be fun to see everyone's ideas. Getting together in teams and starting to plan ahead will an interesting process to see how well we can work together. But I'm excited for that too.
