#Learning Journal 10- code 201

I didn't realize we had assignments to do this week that's why this is submitting late. The day this was due we were done with the MVP of our code 201 project. We started outlining our stretch goals and started merging the branches together. The project underwent some last minute style changes to simplify the page. It all looks good and works like we want it.

The render function needed a legend to display with the images so that's what I was planning to work on. The app is ready to present.
