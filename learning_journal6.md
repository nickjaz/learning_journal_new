# Learning Journal 6 - Code 201

Today we recapped our week and I'm amazed at how many topics we've covered. The week that promised to be hard lived up to expectations. There's a lot more to take away besides terminology. I like coding and can persist through the tough problems.I enjoyed styling up a fresh webpage form scratch to day and challenged myself to get it done faster than my own personal estimate. I was pleased with beating my time goal and just as pleased with the end result.

Moving forward I know there is a lot more left to learn and I've only scratched the surface. The lunch and learn was valuable and the 401 presentations showed me what to prepare for. I'm encouraged by the fact that I got through this tough week so I get through the next one.
