#Learning Journal 5- Code 201

Today was another day where I really understood all the concepts discussed in lecture, felt really good about the assignment and what was being ask of me to complete it, but then really struggled to implement what i know into code. Fortunately i wasn't very far off from implementing the concepts and the help i received didn't require me to blow up my whole project from yesterday and start over. Fortunately i was able to iron out the mistakes i made yesterday and dry up my code thanks to a suggestion from eddie.

Moving forward my goal will be to continue on this path of struggle and understanding. There's really not much more i can do other than that. Having someone to pair program with has really helped overcome some tough boundaries by talking out the issues.
