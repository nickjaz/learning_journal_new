#Learning Journal 11-Code 201

Yesterday we practiced presenting and walked through some of the merging issues for our stylesheets. As a group we all were happy with the progress we made on our stretch goals but we decided to hold back on the biggest one which was displaying the individual tweets.

The biggest issue we encountered yesterday was adding of new features in a hacky way eventually messed with the over all appearance of the app. Also the backgrounds weren't filling to fit the aspect ratio. We made the changes we needed to the background and removed the unnecessary feature that affected the look of the page.
